Inheritance
- Define a parent class that serves a foundation for child classes
- every child class inherits fields/methods from its parent

Polymorphism
- The ability of an object to take on multiple froms.
- A child can take the form of its parent.


Constructors
- super() calls the parent constructor to update inherited fields.
- the child constructor updates the remaining fields.

Overriding 
- Each child class can overrode a method from its parent.
- The child class provides its own implementation of a method.

The super keyword
- super() : invokes the constructor of a parent class.
- super.member : access a member of the parent class.

abstract
- abstract class : a class you cannot create objects from.
- abstract method : exposes behavior that a child must override.
